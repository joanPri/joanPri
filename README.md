👩‍💻 As a highly skilled software engineer and project manager, I have developed a reputation for delivering complex projects on time ⏰ and within budget 💰. With over four years of experience working in the software development industry, I have developed a deep understanding of a range of backend and frontend programming languages including Flutter 🦋, Angular 🅰️, React ⚛️, Next.js ➡️, and PHP (Laravel) 🐘. This technical expertise, combined with my ability to identify and manage project risks ⚠️, has allowed me to successfully lead cross-functional teams 👥 in developing high-quality software solutions 💻 for a diverse range of clients.


🎓 My academic background in computer engineering from the University of Girona 🎓 has provided me with a solid foundation in software development principles and practices 📚, followed by a Master's in Data Science 📊, which has expanded my ability to leverage data analytics 📈 to deliver innovative solutions.

🌍 In addition, my fluency in both Spanish 🇪🇸 and Catalan 🇨🇦 (and high English 🇬🇧) has enabled me to effectively communicate with global clients and stakeholders. As a project manager and software engineer, I am passionate about leveraging technology to drive business value 💼 and solve complex problems. I thrive in dynamic environments that require creative problem-solving 🎯 and collaboration 👥 and am always looking for new and exciting challenges to tackle. 🚀
